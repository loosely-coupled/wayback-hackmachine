This project is a collection of programs, re-creating long-forgotten vulnerabilities.

## Motivation

Many good lessons are to be learnt from long-forgotten vulnerabilities. For some though, just reading about the vulnerability details isn't enough for it to sink in, and re-creating an environment to exploit this vulnerabilities often is not possible as the binaries may not be available or setting up an environment is just too time-consuming. This project aims to provide a collection of easy to run programs that demonstrates the core problems in a CTF-style manner.
